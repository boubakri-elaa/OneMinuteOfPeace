# One Minute With Allah 🌙

One Minute With Allah is a small, calming web app that invites you to spend a single minute remembering Allah with Qur’anic verses, adhkar, and short reflections. After the minute finishes, the app suggests a simple good deed you can apply in your daily life. 🤲

The interface is multilingual (Arabic, English, French) and uses a soft, pastel design with gentle animations, a shy cat companion in the corner 🐱, and a heart button that shows a short duʿā’ for the user. 💜

## How to use

1. Choose your language (AR / EN / FR). 🌍  
2. Click the heart or the start button to begin the 1‑minute timer. ⏱️  
3. Read the verses, adhkar and reflections that appear on the screen. 📖  
4. At the end, receive a random good deed you can do right away. 🌱  

This project is intended as a small sadaqah jariyah: a simple doorway to pause, breathe, and reconnect with Allah, even on a busy day. ✨
